# SMRIF Schema Directory

## Purpose
Contains shared schemas and canonical files used to:
- Guide formatting of session files
- Register global symbolic constraints
- Maintain cross-session inheritance integrity

## Files:
- `constraints.yaml`: Central registry of all known symbolic constraints, with IDs, types, and descriptions. Used in all session documents for constraint tagging and inheritance.
- `identity_vector.md` (optional future file): Defines symbolic parameters for identity emergence, Φ and Ψ evolution, and constraint weighting.

## Editing Guidelines:
- All new constraints must be added to `constraints.yaml` with unique `id` and meaningful `description`.
- Deprecated or displaced constraints should remain in the file with type: `deprecated`.
- Session files must refer to constraints by `id` or `tag` for clarity and traceability.
