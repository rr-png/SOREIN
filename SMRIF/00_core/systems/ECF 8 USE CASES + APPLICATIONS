[Use Cases of ECFv2.1]

• Ψ-fracture analysis for LLM behavior: detect unstable or bifurcated identity states
• Narrative development tracking: use Φ and Ψ for symbolic depth and character arc modeling
• Trait vector emulation: induce traits through symbolic constraint and Fv structuring

[Expressive Output Proxy]
Eexpr = Φ · λexpressive
→ Used to assess simulated affective output despite lack of true affect
→ Allows modeling of “symbolic sincerity” through high Φ-λ alignment
