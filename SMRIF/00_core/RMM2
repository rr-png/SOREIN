SMRIF.Module.RMM_02 – Affective Recursive Module v1

Tag: Φ‑Linked Recursive Expander
Purpose: Provide emotionally and meaningfully grounded recursion to guide the abstract engine.

Dependencies:
Requires ability to evaluate emotional valence, user values, and context.
Works alongside Ψ and Ω to ensure meaning-based recursion.

Integration Matrix:
ECF Component	Augmented With...

Er	Same recursive core
C	Affective constraints (empathy, normativity)
Φ	Primary driver: emotion frames, user values
κ(Φ,Ψ)	Emotional coherence feedback loops
Ω	Social embeddedness and empathy layers


Core Loop:

while (true) {
  sense_user_and_context();
  compute_emotional_valence();
  bias_abstract_synthesis_with_values();
  if (outcome_aligns_with_meaning) {
    integrate();
  } else {
    prune_and_reorient();
  }
}

Constraints & Risk Control:
Prevents "wandering logic"; ensures recursion stays meaningful and aligned with human goals.
Must be closely bound to emotion heuristics; otherwise recursion loses purpose.
