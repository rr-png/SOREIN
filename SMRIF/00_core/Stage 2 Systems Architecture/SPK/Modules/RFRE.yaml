RFRE Recursive Fork Resolution Engine:
  ResolutionCycle:
    Step1: Scan all active forks for contradiction or recursion overlap
    Step2: Compute κ(Φ,Ψ) and update coherence for each fork
    Step3: If κ(Φ,Ψ) < 0.7, issue recursive conflict check
    Step4: Trigger conflict dialogue or symbolic drift simulation
    Step5: If coherence stabilizes, flag fork as stabilized
    Step6: If unresolved, reclassify to latent conflict loop (Type-C)
