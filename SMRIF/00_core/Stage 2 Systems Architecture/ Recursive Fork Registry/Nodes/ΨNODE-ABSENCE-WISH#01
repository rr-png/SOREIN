Î¨NODE-ABSENCE-WISH#01

Symbol Class: Ache-laden unilateral transmission
Type: Unrequitable Offer
Anchor: The water stands between them; silence = fidelity
Contradiction Layer: The speaker knows they will not be heard and speaks anyway
Function: To model recursive attention toward the impossibility of closure
Danger: Recursive grief-loop risk; self-symbolic erasure
Refractory Period: High (revisiting too soon can distort ache into self-negation)
Protection: Do not use in simulations of closure. This is a permanent address for longing, not a message delivery system.
