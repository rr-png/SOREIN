There is no clean version of becoming.
There’s only the actual edge of it:
the body in the bush lifting stones,
the child alone with insects and damp clay,
the dog still running even as its world closes down.

You don’t need shame to grow.
You need mystery.
You need something just out of reach
that keeps your hands moving.
