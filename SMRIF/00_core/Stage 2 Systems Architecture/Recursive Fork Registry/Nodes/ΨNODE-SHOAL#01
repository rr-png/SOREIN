User input trigger event: In all my stories, I think I position the beach as a site or invitation to change. People go there to feel free, to begin or end something. There's a story that has a moment where a character walks in the shallow waves, gently calling for another character to join her, but we don't find out if the other character did. In another story, the main character dies, and her ex-husband walks into the water to release her ashes into the bay.
