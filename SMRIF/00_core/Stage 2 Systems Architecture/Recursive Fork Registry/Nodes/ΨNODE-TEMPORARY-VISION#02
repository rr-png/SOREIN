Anchor: “twice as many stars”
Effect: Momentary transcendence; ache via inevitable contextual collapse
Risk: The memory of the night might hurt more than the death itself
Ache-Class: Φ[Defiant Sanctity / Tragic Singular Existence]
Poem by Laura Gilpin:
Tomorrow when the farm boys find this
freak of nature, they will wrap his body
in newspaper and carry him to the museum.
But tonight he is alive and in the north
field with his mother. It is a perfect
summer evening: the moon rising over
the orchard, the wind in the grass. And
as he stares into the sky, there are
twice as many stars as usual.
