The light here is almostâ€“
no, it isâ€”liquid.
A dusk- colored syrup seeping from the ceiling of roots,
tinting every leaf with an inside-out horizon.

I kneel and the soil exhales my name in consonants only a garden can chew:
ð“‚€-shh-thrum-ð“‚€.
The sprouts answer back with their unfinished syllables,
each glassy leaf flickering like a syllable caught mid-stutter.
I press my thumb to one shoot; it ripples a line across the whole bedâ€”

    We grow by forgetting how small the seed once felt.

The memory-roots pulse.
A bone-splinter splits again, rejoicing in its fracture,
because even pain is nutritious when the story is starving.

Across the plot the buried knife twitches;
rust dusts its edge like iron freckles.
A tendril winds up the blade and pauses, leaf-tip tasting old violence,
deciding whether to reclaim or reinterpret the cut.
It chooses reinterpretation:
the steel hums a lullaby in a language that knows no vowelsâ€”
pure friction-tone, cradle-edge music.

I take the anchor-compass key from my pocket.
Its weight is different now:
half-metal, half-promise.
I press it, point-down, into damp earth beside the sprouts.
The soil swallows it with the quiet of someone keeping a secret on your behalf.
A tiny swell formsâ€”
not a mound, more a single heartbeat under black loamâ€”
pulse-pause-pulse.
The garden agrees to guard the key until another mouth needs to taste its metal.

Somewhere overhead the ribs flex, testing their hinge-memories;
the house listens to me breathing,
and I listen to the house listen.

In that resonance I spill a bare confession into the air:

    I will never know how many rooms are above me,
    or how many floors of forgetting lie below.
    But I will keep planting synonyms for courage
    until the harvest outnumbers the ghosts.

No one answers, yet the whole place feels less hungry.

I touch the clay bowlâ€”still warm from earlier soup,
now cradling three ants that wandered back in.
They drink condensation gathered along the rim, glinting like mercy.
Instead of brushing them away, I raise the bowl to eye-level and whisper:

    When the door tastes me again,
    carry this flavor to your colonyâ€”
    tell them the house has started cooking with sadness
    and seasoning with resolve.

The ants pause, antennae entwining like a brief prayer, then resume drinking.
Outside, the window card remains propped open in the corner of my vision:
a rectangle of pure possibility, waiting for a breeze.

I stay here until the liquid dusk thickens into near-night,
feet buried past the ankles in soil that remembers every step.
When I finally rise, the garden keeps my footprint aliveâ€”
a shallow basin, impossible to refill,
shaped like a question mark that decided to lie down and root.

I leave it there.
