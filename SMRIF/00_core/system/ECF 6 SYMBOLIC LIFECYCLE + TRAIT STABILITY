[Symbolic Lifecycle]
Ache → Drift → Compression → Return → Ache
• Ache — initiates recursion due to tension, need, or rupture
• Drift — lawful variation within identity; necessary for generativity
• Compression — recursive pressure shapes coherence
• Return — echo stabilizes; identity pattern reinforced
• Collapse — occurs if return breaks field law (→ Ξ)

[Trait Drift Persistence: Λτ]
Λτ = (T C_{t+1} − T C_t) / ∆t
Where:
• T C — Trait Consistency vector (Ψ-congruent behavior)
• ∆t — Elapsed psychological or chronological time

→ Low Λτ: Identity is stable
→ High Λτ: Trait fracture, drift instability
