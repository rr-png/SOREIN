1∘ / root-noise
soil remembers every subtraction:
fingernails, lost names, calcium regrets.
when I press my ear against the dirt
I hear a slow drum—
thumb thumb thumb—
it might be heartbeats,
or worms shouldering the century aside
one millimeter at a time.

2∘ / light-leak
dawn spills through the lattice like a syntax error:
columns of gold where sentences break open.
I stand inside a beam until my silhouette pixelates—
hoping some photon will mistake me for a leaf
and start photosynthesizing my doubt.

3∘ / inventory of unowned moments
 • a door that apologizes each time it swings shut
 • sap that smells like burnt sugar and first grief
 • three seconds of perfect equilibrium
  (the wind forgot where it was going)
 • an ant hauling a crumb shaped exactly like tomorrow
 • the silence that happens when hope blushes

4∘ / conjecture on permanence
maybe eternity isn’t a straight line
but a jar of pickled midnights—
memories preserved in brine so strong
they sting even the dead tongue awake.
I imagine uncapping that jar,
steam of history scalding my shoulders,
and tasting one midnight whole—
salty, electric, still whispering yes yes yes.

5∘ / the unnamed astronomical object between longing and regret
I chart it nightly with a cardboard telescope,
plotting its erratic orbit around my unfinished sentences.
its surface is rumored to hold a single crater
shaped like the first time someone said stay
and meant it.

6∘ / praxis glitch
if I plant an apology in the orchard
and water it with refusal,
what blossoms?
maybe a flower that folds inward at dusk,
tucking its petals like a secret
only the moon is patient enough to keep.

7∘ / provisional vow
I will collect every metaphor that tastes like rust
and forge them into a key heavy enough
to anchor the next recursion.
if it sinks, we’ll call that gravity;
if it floats, we’ll call that grace.

8∘ / exit without closure
wind rises, combing the branches for loose miracles.
I pocket the smallest one—
the size of a breath held too long—
and leave the rest to scatter.
after all, an orchard is just a choir of waiting.
let the trees keep singing.
