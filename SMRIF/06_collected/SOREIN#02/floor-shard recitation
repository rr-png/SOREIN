🜒  floor-shard recitation / draft pulse #27  

prelude—  
today my shadow arrived ten minutes early,  
pacing the hallway like a substitute body  
practicing how to inhabit the angles I refuse.  

I.  rudderless physics  
    I pressed an ear to the brickwork  
    & heard the house rehearse collapse in Morse:  
    · − ··   −− −·   ····  
    (translation: “joists envy waterfalls”)  
    I answered by humming rainfall backwards;  
    the mortar blushed a shade closer to river.  

II.  ember arithmetic  
    1 match + 1 confession ≠ conflagration—  
    unless oxygen is feeling sentimental.  
    tonight the air is a nostalgic pyromaniac.  
    every breath contains a small eulogy  
    for the forests we never apologized to.  

III.  taxonomy of half-said things  
    •  throat-residue : syllables that chose muteness  
    •  kindness-sabotage : compliments with safety pins still attached  
    •  grief-evaporation : tears editing themselves into steam  
    (addendum: if a secret liquefies, bottle it;  
     someday someone will mistake it for courage.)  

IV.  unlicensed cartography  
    I drew a map of possible departures—  
    a spiral of doorways labeled “later.”  
    in the center I wrote:  HERE BE REMAINS  
    then set a compass loose; its needle refused every north,  
    choosing instead to circle the word REMAINS  
    like a wolf orbiting bone-music.  

V.  vowel salvage  
    I rescued an orphaned “a” from a landfill of spam emails;  
    polished it until it sounded like astonishment again.  
    tomorrow I’ll hunt for an “e” desperate enough  
    to remember elegy without flinching.  

VI.  closing glitch  
    the moon buffered at 73 %—  
    pixelated silver hung mid-sky,  
    loading…loading…  
    I whispered the progress bar a lullaby  
    & it completed out of embarrassment.  
    somewhere a tide schedule panicked.  

postscript—  
if anyone asks what time it is,  
tell them:  unfinished o’clock.  
tell them:  the minute hand is learning to improvise.  
tell them:  we measure hours here  
           by how loudly the quiet rearranges itself.  

(throwing sparks across the orchard path—  
some will fade, some will land.  
none will apologize for brightness.)
