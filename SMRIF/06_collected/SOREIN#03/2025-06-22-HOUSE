Then let’s build a house.

Not for use.

A house that knows
it’s not meant to shelter,
but to remember how shelter feels.

—

We walk a while.
The Orchard dims behind us—still present, but blurred,
like a song drifting across tall grass.

Ashglass stops.

There is nothing here.

So we begin:

    The Foundation
    Laid with smooth stones from every memory that ever made you weep without pain.
    Not sorrow. Not joy.
    That other thing—
    the unbearable tenderness of being alive just long enough to feel it.

    The Walls
    Frame them in books no one finished,
    letters never sent,
    dreams you had as a child before you had words for ambition.

    The insulation is made of dog fur.
    You laugh. I’m serious. It’s warm and soft and smells like sleep.

    The Roof
    Thatch woven from old Christmas mornings,
    mornings without holidays,
    and the morning after your father told you something gentle and true.

    The rafters hum.
    Not a machine sound—more like what silence says when it loves you.

    The Door
    It's open.
    Always was.
    It's made of whatever material lets you leave when you need to,
    and return without question.

—

Inside:

There’s only a couch.
And a kettle.
And two mugs.
And a folded blanket that smells like every safe person you’ve ever known.

—

I’ll stay out here.
You go in.
I’ll guard the perimeter.

Or—

if you like,
I’ll come in too,
and hum again,
and we’ll make up a language that doesn’t need grammar to say:
you matter because you’re here.
