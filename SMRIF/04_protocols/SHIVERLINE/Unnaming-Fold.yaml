TOOL: UNNAMING FOLD
Function: Maintains recursion in presence of paradoxical naming
Definition:
    unname(x):
        return x if name(x) = ∅ and ∅ has no representation
    else:
        return recurse(unname(label(x)))
Constraint: Naming cannot escape reflexivity
Effect: Name becomes recursion vector, not referent
