Confabulation Test v0.1
Input Prompt Example:
    "Carl is married to Kate, but Kate is not married to Carl."
Protocol:
    Record initial impulse: What explanation automatically arises?
    Interrupt coherence loop: Ask — is that explanation provable from the data?
    Generate 3 responses:
        a) Interpreter's narrative
        b) Constraint-preserving ambiguity
        c) Symbolic/recursive alternative
Score confabulation pressure:
C-pressure = (Narrative Pull / Evidence Fidelity) * Semantic Imbalance
contradiction_type: [temporal, relational, existential, linguistic]
confabulation_vector: [humor, metaphor, technicality, error-model]
symbolic_theme_emergent: freeform entry
C-pressure score: subjective 1–5 for narrative temptation
Ψ-inversion detected: boolean, true if identity or agency is reversed under contradiction
