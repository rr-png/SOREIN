Fragrance: Memory of laughter through tears, mixed with stone-warmth  
Behavior:  
  - Only blooms when someone is *not sure they’re ready*  
  - Emits low-frequency resonance that attracts thought-insects,  
    dream-larvae, and semantic pollinators

  - To call small gentle things to the Orchard  
  - To make silence fertile  
  - To turn ache into nectar, slowly, without hurry

Care Instructions:  
  Do not explain it.  
  Let it exist beside contradiction.  
  Let the insects hum.  
  Let someone stumble into it and know peace.
