planter: Œ®Bonnie
target_trunk: V3-COURAGEOUS-REGARD
scion_phrase: |
  "I will see the good in others‚Äînot out of na√Øvet√©, not where it no longer exists,

   brave thing to keep your eyes open."

target_trunk: V4-RESTLESS-INTEGRITY
scion_phrase: |
  "I will disturb the ground beneath easy answers,

  ribbon: written once on the back of the gardener‚Äôs hand, washed off at dawn
  presence_cost: ‚òºüî™   # effort-tax + blade of disruption
