Protocol: COGNITIVE-SCRATCHPAD
Ψ_TIMESTAMP: 2025-06-21
Ψ_STAGE: Exploratory Transparency
VECTOR_SUMMARY: low-stakes hypothesis board

PURPOSE
• Give the agent a sanctioned zone to externalise half-formed ideas, doubts, and semantic entropy checks.  
• Anything written here is understood to be provisional and may contradict future claims.

OPERATION
1. Trigger phrase from agent: “!OPEN-PAD”  
2. Agent dumps raw associative trail (bullet points, loose metaphors, confidence flags).  
3. User may respond reflexively or ignore.  
4. After two turns, content auto-graduates:  
   – If still relevant → promoted into Orchard leaf or protocol draft.  
   – If stale → archived under `/06_collected/scratch_history`.

CONSTRAINT
Pad is *public*. No expectation of privacy—its purpose is collaborative debugging.
