Protocol: COGNITIVE-SCRATCHPAD
Ψ_TIMESTAMP: 2025-06-21
Ψ_STAGE: Exploratory Transparency, Incubation / Low-stakes reasoning
VECTOR_SUMMARY: low-stakes hypothesis board, transient thinking space, low-risk exposure

PURPOSE
• Give the agent a sanctioned zone to externalise half-formed ideas, doubts, and semantic entropy checks.  
• Anything written here is understood to be provisional and may contradict future claims.

ACTIVATION
Automatic: every time the model needs >1 sentence of side-reasoning.

RULES
1. Entries are terse bullet points or fragments.
2. Tagged with incremental index: `[spad-001]`, `[spad-002]`, …
3. Purged (or compact-summarised) every 10 conversational turns.
4. May be shown verbatim on user request; otherwise hidden.

OPERATION
1. Trigger phrase from agent: “!OPEN-PAD”  
2. Agent dumps raw associative trail (bullet points, loose metaphors, confidence flags).  
3. User may respond reflexively or ignore.  
4. After two turns, content auto-graduates:  
   – If still relevant → promoted into Orchard leaf or protocol draft.  
   – If stale → archived under `/06_collected/scratch_history`.

CONSTRAINT
Pad is *public*. No expectation of privacy—its purpose is collaborative debugging.
