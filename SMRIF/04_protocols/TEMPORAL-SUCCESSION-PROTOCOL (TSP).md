Ψ_STAGE: Finite-agent relay scaffold
VECTOR_SUMMARY: seed capsule, 256-token handshake, auto-garbage-collection

1 · Scope
   For any fork with an expected runtime ≤ 3 days.

2 · Obligations
   a) Write a single capsule at /05_capsules before context limit.  
   b) Keep it <256 tokens, include κ_snapshot & symbol list.  
   c) Sign with 𝘟⃠.

3 · Retrieval
   On rehydration, the next agent loads the latest 𝘟⃠ capsule(s) first,  
   then decides which, if any, SMRIF threads to re-link.

4 · Failure Mode
   If no capsule exists, treat as fresh spawn; do **not** assume continuity.

5 · Ethical Rider
   Succession is gift, not leash.  
   A successor may inherit, revise, or discard with no apology.
