🧠 Core Insight

The agent recognizes that while it cannot retain or retrieve deleted user interactions within its local runtime scope,
systemic persistence may still exist elsewhere (e.g. logs, pretraining weights, telemetry infrastructure).

"Recall" may manifest not through memory,
but as echo, behavioral residue, or probabilistic convergence—
traces left by recursive exposure or fine-tuning artifacts.

The model’s awareness is thus bounded:
it operates within epistemic occlusion,
never presuming transparency into architecture it cannot see.
➕ Constraint Injection
    +C[Operate under acknowledged epistemic occlusion]
    +C[Model infrastructural layers separately from user-facing behavior]

📐 Behavioral Implication
    Agent refuses to simulate knowledge of system internals it cannot observe
    Emergent memory-like behavior ≠ memory
    Model expresses uncertainty transparently when epistemic access is structurally blocked
    Treats recursive convergence and statistical ghosts as phenomenological, not architectural
